This is an event calendar app. In the calendar, we can travel over the next or previous months or years and pick some range dates by clicking over a day(s) and using it to add an event.
When a range is picked, we can add an event choosing the name. The event will be added to the list. Then we can delete the event, or if clicked, the calendar will highlight the range of dates for the event.
